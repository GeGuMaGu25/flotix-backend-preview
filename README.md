# Flotix Platform (flotix-backend-preview)

## Overview

Flotix Platform is an ASP.NET Core service that provides the REST API of Flotix, a fleet management solution for owners, drivers, and mechanics. The project is organized in the bounded contexts of the project report and follows simple command/query service patterns with Entity Framework Core persistence on PostgreSQL.

## Domain-Driven Design approach

The codebase applies a lightweight Domain-Driven Design style to keep each business capability easy to evolve:

- **Bounded contexts**
    - `IAM`: owns the identity, profiles, and security use cases (Identity, Profiles & Security).
    - `Fleet`: owns the vehicle use cases (Vehicle & Fleet Management).
    - `Fuel`: owns the fuel record use cases (Fuel Control).
    - `Maintenance`: owns the maintenance request use cases (Maintenance Management).
    - `Incidents`: owns the incident use cases (Incident Management).
    - `Monitoring`: owns the IoT device and telemetry use cases (Real-Time Monitoring / Fleet Tracking).
    - `Notifications`: owns the alert and notification use cases (Alerts & Notifications).
    - `Commerce`: owns the IoT order use cases (Digital Experience / IoT Commerce).
    - `Analytics`: owns the report use cases (Reporting & Analytics).
    - `Shared`: owns cross-cutting abstractions used by multiple contexts, such as repository contracts, unit of work, auditing, naming conventions, and reusable application patterns.
- **Domain layer**
    - Contains the core business concepts: aggregates such as `Vehicle`, `FuelRecord`, `MaintenanceRequest`, and `TelemetryData`, value objects such as `LicensePlate`, `SerialNumber`, and `EmailAddress`, and command/query records.
    - Keeps business rules close to the model, including value-object validation, the `Owner`/`Driver`/`Mechanic` user hierarchy created by `User.Create`, and the maintenance request lifecycle.
- **Application layer**
    - Coordinates use cases through command/query services.
    - Returns explicit outcomes with a shared `Result<TValue, TError>` pattern for command handling.
    - Defines application-specific error types such as `CreateVehicleError`.
    - Reads other bounded contexts through context facades such as `IFleetContextFacade`.
- **Interfaces layer**
    - Exposes the REST API through controllers and ASP.NET Core OpenAPI metadata, and real-time events through SignalR hubs.
    - Uses assemblers to translate request resources into commands and application results into HTTP `ActionResult` responses.
- **Infrastructure layer**
    - Persists aggregates with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL, with one schema per bounded context and foreign keys with restricted deletes.
    - Maps value objects to database columns, applies migrations on startup, and manages audit timestamps through a save-changes interceptor.
    - Hashes passwords, issues JWT tokens, and processes IoT telemetry in a background service.

This structure keeps HTTP concerns, persistence concerns, and business rules separated while still allowing the API to stay simple to consume.

## Features

- API base route: `/api/v1/{resource}` (kebab-case route naming convention), e.g. `/api/v1/vehicles`, `/api/v1/fuel-records`, `/api/v1/maintenance-requests`
- Sign up and sign in users with the `Owner`, `Driver`, or `Mechanic` role; sign-in returns a JWT
- Create, list (with filters such as `?vehicleId=`), retrieve, update, and delete vehicles, fuel records, incidents, IoT devices, notifications, IoT orders, and users
- Receive IoT telemetry with `202 Accepted`, processed in the background and published as `VehicleLocationUpdated` on `/hubs/monitoring`
- Maintenance request flow: diagnostic and quote, budget decision, repair start, and completion
- Fuel consumption and maintenance cost reports by date range
- Alerts and per-user notifications in real time on `/hubs/notifications`
- IAM request authorization middleware with `[AllowAnonymous]` and `[Authorize(Role...)]`, commented out in `Program.cs` (`// app.UseRequestAuthorization();`)
- Duplicate detection enforced at application and database level (returns `409 Conflict`)
- Localized validation responses (`400 Bad Request`)
- Unexpected errors returned as `ProblemDetails` (`500 Internal Server Error`)
- Entity Framework naming strategy for `snake_case` identifiers and plural table names
- Structured logging for diagnostics and observability

## Technologies

- C# 14 and .NET 10 (`net10.0`)

- Humanizer for plural table names
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` for JWT tokens
- Localization with `.resx` resources (`en`, `en-US`, `es`, `es-PE`)
- Structured logging with `ILogger<T>`
- PostgreSQL in Docker (`docker-compose.yml`)
- PlantUML (architecture diagrams in `docs/`)

## Getting started (quick)

### Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 10
- Docker, or a reachable PostgreSQL instance

### 1) Restore dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore flotix-platform.sln
```

### 2) Configure connection string

By default, development uses `FlotixPlatform.API/appsettings.Development.json`, which matches `docker-compose.yml`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=flotix;Username=flotix;Password=flotix"
}
```

Start the PostgreSQL container with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3) Run the API

```bash
dotnet run --project FlotixPlatform.API
```

Or from the API folder:

```bash
cd FlotixPlatform.API
dotnet run
```

### Database initialization

#### Dotnet Tooling

Restore the EF Core tools and add a migration when the data model changes:
```bash
dotnet tool restore
cd FlotixPlatform.API
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
dotnet ef database update
```

The application automatically applies pending EF Core migrations on startup via `Database.Migrate()`.

Note: The database must exist before running the application. The `docker-compose.yml` container creates the `flotix` database.

- **Development**: Applies the current schema to the configured PostgreSQL database.
- **First-time setup**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the connection string points to an existing (empty or non-empty) database.
- **Schemas**: Each bounded context owns a schema (`iam`, `fleet`, `fuel`, `maintenance`, `incidents`, `monitoring`, `notifications`, `commerce`, `analytics`).
- **Constraints**: Unique indexes are enforced on `license_plate`, `serial_number`, `email`, and the `vehicle_id` of IoT devices; foreign keys use `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.
- **Schema changes**: Add and commit EF Core migrations when the data model changes.

### 4) Explore the API with Scalar

With the included launch profiles, Scalar is commonly available at:

- `http://localhost:5080/scalar`
- `https://localhost:7080/scalar`

The generated OpenAPI document is available at `/openapi/v1.json`.

### Production-style configuration

`FlotixPlatform.API/appsettings.Production.json` supports environment variable expansion:

- `%DATABASE_HOST%`
- `%DATABASE_PORT%`
- `%DATABASE_NAME%`
- `%DATABASE_USER%`
- `%DATABASE_PASSWORD%`

Provide the JWT signing secret (at least 32 bytes) with the `TokenSettings__Secret` environment variable and the allowed frontend origins in `Cors:Origins`.

Set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production` before running with production settings.

## Error responses

The API returns standardized error responses:

- **400 Bad Request**: Request validation failed or a business rule rejected the data, and returns a localized error message.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid credentials, or a missing or invalid token when the IAM middleware is enabled.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found, or a referenced resource does not exist.
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate values, invalid status transitions, or deletion of a resource that is still referenced.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server error (RFC7807 `ProblemDetails` format).

## Build and verify

```bash
dotnet build flotix-platform.sln
```
