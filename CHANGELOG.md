## [Unreleased]

### Added

- IoT telemetry ingestion with background processing and real-time vehicle locations through SignalR.
- Maintenance request flow between owners and mechanics, including diagnostic and quote, budget decision, repair start, and completion.
- Fuel consumption and maintenance cost reports by date range, built from the fleet, fuel, and maintenance data.
- Role-based JWT tokens for signed-in users.

### Changed

- Persistence model aligned with the database design of the project report, including UUID identifiers, one schema per bounded context, foreign keys with restricted deletes, and a single users table for owners, drivers, and mechanics.

### Removed

- Workshops, IoT catalog, notification preferences, and fleet preferences, which are not part of the database design of the project report.
- Data Protection bearer tokens, replaced by JWT tokens.

### Documentation

- Updated the project overview and setup guide, API user stories, architecture decision records, and class diagram.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- Layered DDD structure with nine bounded contexts: Identity, Profiles & Security; Vehicle & Fleet Management; Fuel Control;
  Maintenance Management; Incident Management; Real-Time Monitoring / Fleet Tracking; Alerts & Notifications;
  Digital Experience / IoT Commerce; Reporting & Analytics.
- REST API covering every resource of the json-server fake API, with kebab-case routes under `/api/v1`.
- Sign-up and sign-in with hashed passwords and Data Protection bearer tokens, plus a request authorization middleware
  (disconnected by default) with anonymous and role-based endpoint metadata.
- SignalR hubs for real-time telemetry, alerts and per-user notifications.
- Entity Framework Core persistence with PostgreSQL, value objects, unique indexes, seeded IoT catalog and fleet preferences,
  and automatic creation/update audit timestamps.
- Localized validation responses, standardized API errors and localized OpenAPI documentation through Scalar.
- Development and production configuration, Docker Compose for PostgreSQL and a Dockerfile for the API.

### Changed

- Replaced the previous minimal project structure with the layered bounded-context structure.

### Documentation

- Added project overview and setup guide, architecture decision records, class diagram and API technical stories.
